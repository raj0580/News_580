    "summary": "A new collaboration between major tech firms has resulted in an advanced AI model capable of predicting climate patterns with unprecedented accuracy.",
    "content": "<p>In a landmark announcement today, a consortium of leading technology companies revealed 'Gaia-AI', a revolutionary artificial intelligence model designed to tackle climate change. The model processes petabytes of satellite, oceanic, and atmospheric data in real-time to generate highly accurate climate forecasts.</p><p>Experts believe Gaia-AI could be a game-changer for disaster preparedness, agricultural planning, and renewable energy optimization. 'We are no longer just reacting to climate change; we are starting to proactively manage its effects,' said Dr. Elena Vance, lead scientist on the project.</p><h3>Key Capabilities:</h3><ul><li>Predicts extreme weather events up to 3 weeks in advance.</li><li>Identifies optimal locations for wind and solar farm placement.</li><li>Simulates the long-term impact of carbon reduction policies.</li></ul><p>The project's data and core algorithms will be made open-source to encourage global collaboration among scientists and policymakers.</p>",
